# Env Provider

The env provider allows the use of environment variables within Terraform
configurations. This is a *logical provider*, which means that it works
entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other
services.

Using environment variables is not reccommended within a Terraform configuration,
the reccommended way is using [variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#declaring-an-input-variable)
that can be passed with an environment variable in the form of
[TF_VAR_name](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/environment-variables#tf_var_name).

But sometimes, an environment variable is already being consistently used
(eg: for configuring a provider) and it would be useful to use the same Env
in order to avoid repetition and possible divergence.
If this is the case, please use this provider.

For example:

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/env_var/data-source.tf" }}

{{- /* No schema in this provider, so no need for this: .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace */ -}}
